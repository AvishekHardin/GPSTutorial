  These programs may be used free of charge for personal, recreational and educational purposes only.

  This program, or parts of it, may not be used for or in connection with any commercial purpose without the explicit
  permission of the author Stuart Robinson.

  The programs are supplied as is, it is up to individual to decide if the programs are suitable for the intended
  purpose and free from errors.

  This program uses software methods to put a UBLOX GPS to sleep\standby. 
  
  The purpose of the test is to be able to measure the current the GPS consumes in sleep\standby mode. The program 
  also prints the output of the GPS during the period it is on, so can be used to check a GPS is working.
  
  If the GPS can be put to sleep it you can then wake it up and it will can often get a new fix within a few seconds,
  this is called 'Hot Fix' mode and can save considerable amounts of power. However since the GPS receiver is off in 
  this mode it cannot keep the almanac data on satellites updated and ocaisionaly the hot fix can take 20,30 or more
  seconds. 

  The time in mS the GPS is on and then off is defined by the const definitions for 'GPSDebugTimeSeconds' and 
  'GPSSleepTimeSeconds' at the top of the program.
   

  At the top of the program you will also need to define the pins for the GPS, LED and GPS power control. The power control
  normally needs additional components such a MOSFET controlling the VCC supply to the GPS.
